Tobacco Harm Reduction ought to be the forefront of each Public Wellbeing advocates agenda.  Becoming touted as the to begin its kind on US soil, NEW YORK College or university of Technology and experts from across the discipline will come to be hosting a tobacco injury reduction meeting on Thursday, April 21st, 2016 from 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM.

We live in a region where abstinence is pushed as the remedy, yet it's been 40 years because the notion of tobacco harm decrease came into being.  Nicotine isn't the problem, we know that in truth it is forget about harmful or addictive than caffeine, but we even now struggle daily with persons pressing the agenda that it's literally general public enemy number one.

Let’s take a couple of minutes to find what this conference may do for public well being, public harm decrease, and just why this is an enormous milestone for the vaping sector along with other ways of bringing the cigarette smoking epidemic into check.  As the concentrate of the conference is on mental disease and medication users who smoke, it has a direct effect on the debate of the whole harm reduction ethos.

HOW COME This A Big Deal

As millions upon millions of smokers are sitting in their homes, offices, or perhaps living their daily lives, they assume that the only approach they will ever move away from the loss of life sticks is by using prescription drugs or fighting through bouts of gum induced rage.  They have been told that stopping smoking is THE ONLY way they are able to save themselves from an awful death, nevertheless, you the prevailing wisdom for half a century is normally that nicotine without tobacco is a massive part of the right route.  Misinformation and misdirection have gone generations pondering the question of stop and die, many of whom have picked the latter as the past was too hard for them to do.

My analogy is telling a person who is obese that the only path they are able to survive is by quitting taking in completely or drop dead.  It may be just a little on the extreme side, but to smokers it's the exact same thing.

This conference will be promoting the long overdue idea to the American medical and general community that you don’t have to head to extremes to significantly decrease the number of coffins being filled by smokers, maybe just point them in the direction of products that aren’t laden with toxins that cause cancer.  We know that they are out there and a significant focus of the conference is definitely the electronic cigarette / vaping sector.

Vaping IS Tobacco Damage Reduction
In 1976, Professor Michael Russell wrote: “Persons smoke for nicotine nonetheless they die from the tar”, now we have a couple of products that literally fill that description.  You can’t bully millions of men and women into performing what you want, we possess a half of a century that the current ideology doesn’t work, and this conference is breaking surface that can save an incredible number of lives in the future.  I hate to say it, however the only reason people are still smoking is as the alternatives are significantly less available to the general community than the smoking cigarettes that are deemed appropriate in every corner retail store around the country.  I won’t sit right here and preach that vaping may be the only approach to get smokers away from the cigarettes, but I will argue that it has a major function to play in the future of Tobacco Harm Decrease.

WHO'LL Be At THE FUNCTION

This event has some heavy hitters upgrading to the podium.  A number of names that are well-known to in the vaping market and some that needs to be well-known world-large will be taking the subject to task.

While you will see a special focus on smokers with mental illness and the ones with drug addiction concerns, this whole event is pretty literally world-changing for your premise of Tobacco Harm Reduction.  Should you be able to attend, I would strongly advise it, although I have it on very very good authority that for all those of us who can not make it you will see camera’s rolling and broadcasting program kicking into high gear.  My calendar provides been cleared because of this conference and if you're seriously interested in saving lives from smoking cigarettes, I would strongly suggest you tag it off on your own itinerary.

As constantly, enjoy your vaporizers and vape safe!
