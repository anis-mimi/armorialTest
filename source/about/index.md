Vaping is a term adopted by the users of electronic smokes (e-cigs), and comes from the vapour produced by e-cigs. E-cigs usually do not involve combustion nor involve the inhalation of tar and many of the carcinogens produced by a normal tobacco cigarette. E-cigs are therefore generally accepted to be a cleaner, cheaper and healthier approach to take pleasure from nicotine than smoking.
